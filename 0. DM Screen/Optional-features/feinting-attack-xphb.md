# Feinting Attack 


As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of yourself as your target. You have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on your next attack roll against that target this turn. If that attack hits, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
