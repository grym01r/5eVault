# Lunging Attack 


As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [Dash](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Dash) action. If you move at least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the [Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Attack) action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
