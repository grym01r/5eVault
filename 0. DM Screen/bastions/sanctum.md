# Sanctum
*Level 17 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [Holy Symbol](holy-symbol-xphb.md) or [Druidic Focus](druidic-focus-xphb.md) as a [Spellcasting Focus](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb.md)
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 4
- **Order**: empower

A Sanctum is a place of solace and healing.

## Sanctum Charm

After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [Charm](0.%20DM%20Screen/rewards/sanctum-charm-xdmg.md) (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Heal](heal-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.

## Empower: Fortifying Rites

When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, you inspire its hirelings to perform daily rites that benefit you or another character you name. The beneficiary doesn't need to be in the Bastion when the rites are performed to gain their benefit. Each time the beneficiary finishes a Long Rest, they gain [Temporary Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to your level. This effect lasts for 7 days.

## Sanctum Recall

While the Sanctum exists, you always have the [Word of Recall](word-of-recall-xphb.md) spell prepared. When you cast [Word of Recall](word-of-recall-xphb.md), you can make your Sanctum the destination of the spell instead of another place you have previously designated. In addition, one creature of your choice that arrives in the Sanctum via this spell gains the benefit of a [Heal](heal-xphb.md) spell.
