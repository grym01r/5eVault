You lived as a seafarer, wind at your back and decks swaying beneath your feet. You've perched on barstools in more ports of call than you can remember, faced mighty storms, and swapped stories with folk who live beneath the waves.

## Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|----------|-------|
| 1 | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good) |
| 2 | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful) |

| 4 | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil) |
| 5 | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral) |
| 6 | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any) |
