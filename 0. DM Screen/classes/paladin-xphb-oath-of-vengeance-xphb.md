## Class Features

### Oath of Vengeance (Level 3)

*Punish Evildoers at Any Cost*

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.  
- Fight injustice and its causes.  
- Aid those harmed by injustice.  

### Oath of Vengeance Spells (Level 3)

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Oath of Vengeance Spells**

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | [Bane](bane-xphb.md), [Hunter's Mark](hunters-mark-xphb.md) |
| 5th | [Hold Person](hold-person-xphb.md), [Misty Step](misty-step-xphb.md) |
| 9th | [Haste](haste-xphb.md), [Protection from Energy](protection-from-energy-xphb.md) |
| 13th | [Banishment](banishment-xphb.md), [Dimension Door](dimension-door-xphb.md) |

### Vow of Enmity (Level 3)

When you take the [Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Attack) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

If the creature drops to 0 [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).

### Relentless Avenger (Level 7)

Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an [Opportunity Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack), you can reduce the creature's [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) as part of the same [Reaction](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md). This movement doesn't provoke [Opportunity Attacks](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack).

### Soul of Vengeance (Level 15)

Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a [Reaction](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within range.

### Avenging Angel (Level 20)

As a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

#### Flight

You sprout spectral wings on your back, have a [Fly Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 60 feet, and can hover.

#### Frightful Aura

Whenever an enemy starts its turn in your Aura of Protection, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. [Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Attack) rolls against the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) creature have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md).
