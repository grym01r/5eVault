A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [Incapacitated](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or [Prone](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Prone) condition or your [Fly Speed](fly-speed-xphb.md) is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.
