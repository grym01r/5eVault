# Expertise
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a skill proficiency. When you make an ability check with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, your [Proficiency Bonus](proficiency-xphb.md) is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.

If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one [skill](skill-xphb.md) in which you have proficiency. You can't have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
