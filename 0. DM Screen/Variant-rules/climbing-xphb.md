While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [difficult terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](climb-speed-xphb.md) and use it to climb. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Athletics)) check.
