# Knocking Out a Creature
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

When you would reduce a creature to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the [Unconscious](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition and starts a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md).

The creature remains Unconscious until it regains any [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) or until someone uses an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Medicine)) check.
