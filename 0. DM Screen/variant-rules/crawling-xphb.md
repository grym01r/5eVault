# Crawling
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

While you're crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [difficult terrain](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md)).
