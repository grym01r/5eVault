If you have proficiency with something, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any [D20 Test](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) you make using that thing. A creature might have proficiency in a skill or [saving throw](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md) or with a weapon or tool.
