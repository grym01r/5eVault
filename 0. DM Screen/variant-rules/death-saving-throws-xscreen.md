# Death Saving Throws
*Source: Dungeon Master's Screen (2024)* 

When you start your turn with 0 HP, roll `1d20`, and you succeed on a 10+.

- **Third Success.** You become [Stable](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/stable-xphb.md).  
- **Third Failure.** You die.  
- **Rolling a 1.** Counts as two failures.  
- **Rolling a 20.** You regain 1 Hit Point.  

If you take damage at 0 HP, it counts as a failed [Death Save](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/death-saving-throw-xphb.md) or two failures if the damage is from a [Critical Hit](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/critical-hit-xphb.md).
