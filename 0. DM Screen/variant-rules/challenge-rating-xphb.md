# Challenge Rating
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a [monster](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) poses to a group of four [player characters](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md). Compare a [monster's](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the [monster](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the [monster](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of [player characters](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md) can significantly alter how threatening a [monster](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) is in actual play. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat [encounters](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/encounter-xphb.md).
