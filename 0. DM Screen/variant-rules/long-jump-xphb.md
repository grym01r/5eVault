# Long Jump
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.

If you land in [difficult terrain](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or have the [Prone](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Prone) condition.

This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Athletics)) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.
