# Actor 


***Prerequisites*** 4th; Charisma 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Impersonation.** While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have Advantage on Charisma ([Deception](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Deception) or [Performance](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Performance)) checks to convince others that you are that person.

**Mimicry.** You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom ([Insight](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Insight)) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
