# Boon of Fate 

***Prerequisites*** 19th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.

**Improve Fate.** When you or another creature within 60 feet of you succeeds on or fails a [D20 Test](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), you can roll `2d4` and apply the total rolled as a bonus or penalty to the `d20` roll. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you roll Initiative or finish a Short or Long Rest.
