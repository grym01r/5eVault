# War Caster 


***Prerequisites*** 4th; Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Concentration.** You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain [Concentration](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Concentration).

**Reactive Spell.** When a creature provokes an [Opportunity Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an [Opportunity Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack). The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

**Somatic Components.** You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a Shield in one or both hands.
