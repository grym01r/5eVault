# Polearm Master 


***Prerequisites*** 4th; Strength 13 or higher or 4th; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity or Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Pole Strike.** Immediately after you take the [Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with a [Quarterstaff](quarterstaff-xphb.md), a [Spear](spear-xphb.md), or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can use a Bonus Action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weapon deals Bludgeoning damage, and the weapon's damage die for this attack is a `d4`.

**Reactive Strike.** While you're holding a [Quarterstaff](quarterstaff-xphb.md), a [Spear](spear-xphb.md), or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against a creature that enters the reach you have with that weapon.
