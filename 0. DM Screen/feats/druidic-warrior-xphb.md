# Druidic Warrior 


***Prerequisites*** When Gaining the Level 2 Ranger "Fighting Style" Feature

You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice. [Guidance](guidance-xphb.md) and [Starry Wisp](starry-wisp-xphb.md) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.
