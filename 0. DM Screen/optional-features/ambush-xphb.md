# Ambush 


When you make a Dexterity ([Stealth](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Stealth)) check or an [Initiative](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) roll, you can expend one Superiority Die and add the die to the roll, unless you have the [Incapacitated](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.
