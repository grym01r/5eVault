# Rally 


As a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion. Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains [Temporary Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).
