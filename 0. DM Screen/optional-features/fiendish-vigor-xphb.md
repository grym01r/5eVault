# Fiendish Vigor 


***Prerequisites*** Level 2

You can cast [False Life](false-life-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md); you automatically get the highest number on the die.
