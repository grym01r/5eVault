# Disarming Attack 


When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to disarm the target. Add the Superiority Die roll to the attack's damage roll. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one object of your choice that it's holding, with the object landing in its space.
