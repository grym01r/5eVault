# Tactical Assessment 


When you make an Intelligence ([History](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#History) or [Investigation](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Investigation)) check or a Wisdom ([Insight](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Insight)) check, you can expend one Superiority Die and add that die to the ability check.
