# Gift of the Depths 


***Prerequisites*** Level 5

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a [Swim Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

You can also cast [Water Breathing](water-breathing-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a [Long Rest](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
