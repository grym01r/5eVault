# Torpor
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 600 gp

A creature subjected to Torpor poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for `4d6` hours. The creature's [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is halved while the creature is [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way.
