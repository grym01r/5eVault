# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](ring-of-regeneration.webp#right)

While wearing this ring, you regain `1d6` [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) the whole time.
