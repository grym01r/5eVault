# Staff of Striking
*Staff, weapon, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra `1d6` Force damage.

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.
