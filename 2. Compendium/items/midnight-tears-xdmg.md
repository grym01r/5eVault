# Midnight Tears
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 1,500 gp

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that ends the [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn't been neutralized before midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (`9d6`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
