# Scarab of Protection
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](scarab-of-protection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.

## Defense

You gain a +1 bonus to [Armor Class](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md).

## Preservation

The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a [Reaction](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

## Spell Resistance

You have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells.
