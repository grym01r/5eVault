# Dimensional Shackles
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](dimensional-shackles.webp#right)

You can take a [Utilize](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Utilize) action to place these shackles on a creature that has the [Incapacitated](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a [Utilize](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Utilize) action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength ([Athletics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
