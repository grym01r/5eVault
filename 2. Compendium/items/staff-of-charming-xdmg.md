# Staff of Charming
*Staff, weapon, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](staff-of-charming.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:

- **Cast Spell.** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast [Charm Person](charm-person-xphb.md), [Command](command-xphb.md), or [Comprehend Languages](comprehend-languages-xphb.md) from it using your spell save DC.  
- **Reflect Enchantment.** If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a [Reaction](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.  
- **Resist Enchantment.** If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.  

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d8 + 2` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
