# Potion of Heroism
*Potion, rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain 10 [Temporary Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [Bless](bless-xphb.md) spell (no [Concentration](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Concentration) required).

This potion's blue liquid bubbles and steams as if boiling.
