# Manual of Bodily Health
*Wondrous item, very rare*  
![](manual-of-bodily-health.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
