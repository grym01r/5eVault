# Green Dragon Scale Mail
*Medium armor ([scale mail](scale-mail-xphb.md)), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](dragon-scale-mail.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 45.0 lbs.

Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [Armor Class](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), you have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you have [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to poison damage.

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to discern the distance and direction to the closest green dragon within 30 miles of yourself. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.
