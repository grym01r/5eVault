# Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  

The Ring of Elemental Command (earth) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [Disadvantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you.  
- **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.  

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Earth.** You know Terran, and you have [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Acid damage. Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn't [Difficult Terrain](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for you. In addition, you can move through solid earth or rock as if those areas were [Difficult Terrain](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) without disturbing the matter through which you pass. If you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.  

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [Earthquake](earthquake-xphb.md) (5 charges), [Stone Shape](stone-shape-xphb.md) (2 charges), [Stoneskin](stoneskin-xphb.md) (3 charges), [Wall of Stone](wall-of-stone-xphb.md) (3 charges)
