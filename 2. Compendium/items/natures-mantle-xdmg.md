# Nature's Mantle
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](natures-mantle.webp#right)

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a [Spellcasting Focus](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your Druid and Ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is [Lightly Obscured](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md), you can [Hide](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Hide) as a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) even if you are being directly observed.
