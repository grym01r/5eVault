# Wand of Web
*Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](wand-of-web.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Web](web-xphb.md) (save DC 13) from it.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
