# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](ring-of-free-action.webp#right)

While you wear this ring, [Difficult Terrain](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce any of your Speeds nor cause you to have the [Paralyzed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
