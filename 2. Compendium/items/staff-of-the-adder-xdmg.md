# Staff of the Adder
*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](staff-of-the-adder.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

As a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.

When you take the [Attack](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Attack) action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your [Proficiency Bonus](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes `1d6` Piercing damage and `3d6` Poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and [Immunity](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) when it reverts to its inanimate form.
