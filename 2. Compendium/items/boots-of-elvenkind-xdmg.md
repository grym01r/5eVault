# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](boots-of-elvenkind.webp#right)

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.
