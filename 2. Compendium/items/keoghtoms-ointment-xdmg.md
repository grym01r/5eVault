# Keoghtom's Ointment
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](keoghtoms-ointment.webp#right)

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `1d4 + 1` doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As a [Utilize](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can swallow one dose of the ointment or apply it to a creature within 5 feet of yourself. The creature that receives it regains `2d8 + 2` [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) and ceases to have the [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.
