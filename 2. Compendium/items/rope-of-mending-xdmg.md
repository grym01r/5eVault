# Rope of Mending
*Wondrous item, common*  

This 50-foot coil of rope can repair itself when cut into any number of smaller pieces. As a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action, you can cause all pieces of the rope that are in contact with each other and not otherwise in use to knit back together. A Rope of Mending is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed.
