# Ring of X-ray Vision
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](ring-of-x-ray-vision.webp#right)

While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a [Long Rest](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level.
