# Tinderbox
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 5 sp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [Candle](candle-xphb.md), [Lamp](lamp-xphb.md), [Lantern](hooded-lantern-xphb.md), or [Torch](torch-xphb.md)—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
