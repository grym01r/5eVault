# Wand of Conducting
*Wand, common*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
