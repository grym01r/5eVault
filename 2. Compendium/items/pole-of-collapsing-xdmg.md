# Pole of Collapsing
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](pole-of-collapsing.webp#right)

This item functions as a Pole. While holding it, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole's weight doesn't change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows.
