# Wand of Magic Missiles
*Wand, uncommon*  
![](wand-of-magic-missiles.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [Magic Missile](magic-missile-xphb.md) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
