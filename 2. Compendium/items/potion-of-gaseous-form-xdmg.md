# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [Gaseous Form](gaseous-form-xphb.md) spell for 1 hour (no [Concentration](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
