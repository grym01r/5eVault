# Candle of Invocation
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](candle-of-invocation.webp#right)

This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on [D20 Tests](d20-test-xphb.md). In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [Gate](gate-xphb.md) with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.
