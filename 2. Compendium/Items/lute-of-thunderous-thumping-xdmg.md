# Lute of Thunderous Thumping
*Weapon ([club](club-xphb.md)), very rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This reinforced [lute](lute-xphb.md) can be wielded as a magic Club that deals an extra `2d8` Thunder damage on a hit.

## Sing and Swing

If you're a Bard, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making a melee attack roll with the [lute](lute-xphb.md), provided you sing or hum while making the attack.
