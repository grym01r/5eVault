# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](goggles-of-night.webp#right)

While wearing these dark lenses, you have [Darkvision](0.%20DM%20Screen/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 60 feet. If you already have [Darkvision](0.%20DM%20Screen/senses.md#Darkvision), wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
