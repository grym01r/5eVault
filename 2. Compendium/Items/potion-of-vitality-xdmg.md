# Potion of Vitality
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, it removes any [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) levels you have and ends the [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) for any [Hit Point Die](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) you spend.

This potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.
