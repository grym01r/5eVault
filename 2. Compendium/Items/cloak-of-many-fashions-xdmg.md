# Cloak of Many Fashions
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](cloak-of-many-fashions.webp#right)

While wearing this cloak, you can take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties.
