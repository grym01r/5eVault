# Grappling Hook
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 2 gp
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can throw the Grappling Hook at a railing, a ledge, or another catch within 50 feet of yourself, and the hook catches on if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If you tied a Rope to the hook, you can then climb it.
