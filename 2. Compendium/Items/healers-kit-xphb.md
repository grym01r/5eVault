# Healer's Kit
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

A Healer's Kit has ten uses. As a [Utilize](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can expend one of its uses to stabilize an [Unconscious](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature that has 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) without needing to make a Wisdom ([Medicine](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Medicine)) check.
