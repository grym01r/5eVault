# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor ([shield](2.%20Compendium/Items/shield-xphb.md)), cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](shield-of-missile-attraction.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [Cursed](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/Variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

## Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](remove-curse-xphb.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
