# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](ring-of-invisibility.webp#right)

While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to give yourself the [Invisible](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Invisible) condition. You remain [Invisible](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Invisible) until the ring is removed or until you take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to become visible again.
