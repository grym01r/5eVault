# +1 Rod of the Pact Keeper
*Rod, uncommon (requires attunement by a warlock)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

While holding this rod, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your Warlock spells.

In addition, you can regain one spell slot as a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action while holding the rod. You can't use this property again until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).
