# Slippers of Spider Climbing
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](slippers-of-spider-climbing.webp#right)

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a [Climb Speed](climb-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](speed-xphb.md). However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
