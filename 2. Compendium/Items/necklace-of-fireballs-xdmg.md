# Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](necklace-of-fireballs.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This necklace has `1d6` beads hanging from it. You can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 [Fireball](fireball-xphb.md) (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by `1d6` for each bead after the first (maximum `12d6`).

## Price
The price of a Necklace of Fireballs is determined by how many beads are still hanging from it.

| Bead(s) | Price    |
| ---- | -------- |
| 1    | 300 gp   |
| 2    | 480 gp   |
| 3    | 960 gp   |
| 4    | 1,600 gp |
| 5    | 3,840 gp |
| 6    | 7,680 gp |
