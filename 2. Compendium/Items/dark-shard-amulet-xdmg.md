# Dark Shard Amulet
*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a warlock)*  
![](dark-shard-amulet.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This amulet is fashioned from a shard of resilient material originating from an otherworldly realm. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the amulet as a [Spellcasting Focus](spellcasting-focus-xphb.md) for your Warlock spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Warlock spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast it is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).
