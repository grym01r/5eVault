| Spell | Charge Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| [Cure Wounds](cure-wounds-xphb.md) | 1 charge per spell level (maximum 4 for a level 4 spell) |

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
