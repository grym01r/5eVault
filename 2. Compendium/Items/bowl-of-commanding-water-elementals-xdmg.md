# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](bowl-of-commanding-water-elementals.webp#right)

While this bowl is filled with water and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to summon a [Water Elemental](water-elemental-xmm.md). The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md). The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.
