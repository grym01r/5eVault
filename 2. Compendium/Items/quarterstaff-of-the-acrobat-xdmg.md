You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) out to 10 feet, either as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) or after you roll [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md), or you can extinguish the light as a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md).

While holding this weapon, you can take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

## Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)

While holding this weapon, you have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Acrobatics](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks.

## Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)

When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md) to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your [Armor Class](armor-class-xphb.md) against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a [Short](short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md).

## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)

This weapon has [Thrown](0.%20DM%20Screen/item-properties.md#Thrown) with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
