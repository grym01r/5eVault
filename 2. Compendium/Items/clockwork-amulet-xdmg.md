# Clockwork Amulet
*Wondrous item, common*  

This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of clockwork predictability. Faint ticking and whirring noises emanate from within.

When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the `d20` to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
