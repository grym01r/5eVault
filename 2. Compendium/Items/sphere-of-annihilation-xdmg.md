# Sphere of Annihilation
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](sphere-of-annihilation.webp#right)

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes `8d10` Force damage.

## Controlling the Sphere

A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to make a DC 25 Intelligence ([Arcana](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.

While in control of the sphere, you can take a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md) to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking `8d10` Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.

## Sphere Interactions

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the [Gate](gate-xphb.md) spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.

| dice: 1d100 | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 01-50 | The sphere is destroyed. |
| 51-85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. |
| 86-00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence. |
