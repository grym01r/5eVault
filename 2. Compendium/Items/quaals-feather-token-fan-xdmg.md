# Quaal's Feather Token, Fan
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](quaals-feather-token-fan.webp#right)

This object looks like a feather.

If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action.
