# Eyes of the Eagle
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](eyes-of-the-eagle.webp#right)

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on Wisdom ([Perception](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
