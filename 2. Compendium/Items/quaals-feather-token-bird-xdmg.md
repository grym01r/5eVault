# Quaal's Feather Token, Bird
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](quaals-feather-token-bird.webp#right)

This object looks like a feather.

You can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a [Roc](roc-xmm.md), but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). You can dismiss the bird as a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action.
