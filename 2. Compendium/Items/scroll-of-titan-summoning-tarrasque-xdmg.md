# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Tarrasque)
*Scroll, legendary*  

When you take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to read this scroll, a [Tarrasque](tarrasque-xmm.md) appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [Tarrasque](tarrasque-xmm.md) is [Hostile](hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). If the [Tarrasque](tarrasque-xmm.md) is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
