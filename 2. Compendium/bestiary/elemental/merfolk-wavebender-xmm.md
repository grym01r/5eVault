## Merfolk

*Protectors and Explorers of the Seas*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Underwater  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Beneath the waves dwell merfolk, mysterious creatures that merge the features of humans and sea creatures. Some are curious about land dwellers, while others view them with suspicion.
