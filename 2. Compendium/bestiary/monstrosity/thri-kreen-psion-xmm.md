Thri-kreen psions harness their psychic powers to avoid danger and manipulate objects from afar.

## Thri-kreen

*Mantid Psychics and Scavengers*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](0.%20DM%20Screen/tables/random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Thri-kreen are mantis-like wanderers who harness their innate camouflage and psychic abilities to survive. Different groups of thri-kreen have distinct carapaces, from the rocky shades of desert dwellers to the vibrant hues of those living in verdant lands. While their language has a distinctly insectile quality, thri-kreen often use telepathy to communicate, and groups can rapidly share a wealth of detailed information without making a sound.
