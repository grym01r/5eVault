# Insect Plague
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a locust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. The [Sphere](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) remains for the duration, and its area is [Lightly Obscured](lightly-obscured-xphb.md) and [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `4d10` Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 5.
