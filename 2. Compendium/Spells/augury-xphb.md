# Augury
*2nd-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, cards, or other divinatory tokens worth 25+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

**Omens**

| Omen | For Results That Will Be... |
|------|-----------------------------|
| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad |
^omens

The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [Long Rest](long-rest-xphb.md), there is a cumulative  chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
