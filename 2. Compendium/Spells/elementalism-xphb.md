# Elementalism
*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range.

## Beckon Air

You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot [Cube](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.

## Beckon Earth

You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.

## Beckon Fire

You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot [Cube](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.

## Beckon Water

You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot [Cube](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.

## Sculpt Element

You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot [Cube](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.
