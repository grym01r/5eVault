*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must each make a Charisma saving throw. Whenever a target that fails this save makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must subtract `1d4` from the attack roll or save.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
