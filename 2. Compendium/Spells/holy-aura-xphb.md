- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 1,000+ GP)

For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot [Emanation](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md).

In addition, when a Fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack roll, the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the end of its next turn.
