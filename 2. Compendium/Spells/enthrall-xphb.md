# Enthrall
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature you or your companions are fighting automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, a target has a -10 penalty to Wisdom ([Perception](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Perception)) checks and Passive [Perception](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Perception) until the spell ends.
