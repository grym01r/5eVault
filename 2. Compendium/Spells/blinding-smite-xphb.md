# Blinding Smite
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

The target hit by the strike takes an extra `3d8` Radiant damage from the attack, and the target has the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The extra damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
