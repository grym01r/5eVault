# Befuddlement
*8th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a key ring with no keys)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes `10d12` Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the [Greater Restoration](greater-restoration-xphb.md), [Heal](heal-xphb.md), or [Wish](wish-xphb.md) spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
