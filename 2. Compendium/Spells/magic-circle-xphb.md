# Magic Circle
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can't willingly enter the [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.  
- The creature has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against targets within the [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md).  
- Targets within the [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) can't be possessed by or gain the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition from the creature.  

Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) and protecting targets outside it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.
