*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)

Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for the duration.

A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall [Prone](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Prone).
