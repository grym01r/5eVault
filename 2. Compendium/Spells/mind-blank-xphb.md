# Mind Blank
*8th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to Psychic damage and the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [Wish](wish-xphb.md)—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.
