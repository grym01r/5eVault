*cantrip, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action

You create a vine-like whip covered in thorns that lashes out at your command toward a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d6` Piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, you can pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.
