# Charm Person
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) creature is [Friendly](friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
