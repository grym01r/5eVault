# Summon Celestial
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Celestial Spirit](celestial-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Avenger or Defender. Your choice determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
