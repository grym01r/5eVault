# Conjure Minor Elementals
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure spirits from the Elemental Planes that flit around you in a 15-foot [Emanation](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) for the duration. Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals an extra `2d8` damage when you hit a creature in the [Emanation](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). This damage is Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning (your choice when you make the attack).

In addition, the ground in the [Emanation](emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for your enemies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
