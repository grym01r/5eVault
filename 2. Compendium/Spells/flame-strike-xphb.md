# Flame Strike
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` Fire damage and `5d6` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 5.
