# Vitriolic Sphere
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bile)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `10d4` Acid damage and another `5d4` Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The initial damage increases by `2d4` for each spell slot level above 4.
