- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or an object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` Fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell starts [burning](burning-xphb.md) if it isn't being worn or carried.
