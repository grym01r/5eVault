# Fly
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target gains a [Fly Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 60 feet and can hover. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft unless it can stop the fall.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.
