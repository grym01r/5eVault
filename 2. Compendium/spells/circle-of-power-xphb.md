# Circle of Power
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot [Emanation](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. When an affected creature makes a saving throw against a spell or magical effect that allows a save to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the save.
