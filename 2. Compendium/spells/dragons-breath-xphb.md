# Dragon's Breath
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hot pepper)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a [Magic](0.%20DM%20Screen/actions.md#Magic) action to exhale a 15-foot [Cone](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
