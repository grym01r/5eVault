# Holy Aura
*8th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 1,000+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot [Emanation](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). While in the aura, creatures of your choice have [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on all saving throws, and other creatures have [Disadvantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against them. In addition, when a Fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack roll, the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the end of its next turn.
