- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot [Emanation](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) for the duration. When you create the aura and at the start of each of your turns while it persists, you can restore `2d6` [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) to one creature in it.
