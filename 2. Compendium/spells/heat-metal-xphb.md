# Heat Metal
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes `2d8` Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has [Disadvantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 2.
