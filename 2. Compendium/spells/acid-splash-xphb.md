# Acid Splash
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in that [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d6` Acid damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).
