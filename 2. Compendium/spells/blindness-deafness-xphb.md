# Blindness/Deafness
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) or [Deafened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Deafened) condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
