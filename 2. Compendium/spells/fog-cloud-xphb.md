# Fog Cloud
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of fog centered on a point within range. The [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md). It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [Gust of Wind](gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
