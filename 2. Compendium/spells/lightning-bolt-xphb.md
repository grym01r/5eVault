# Lightning Bolt
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (100-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a crystal rod)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a 100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [Line](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the [Line](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `8d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
