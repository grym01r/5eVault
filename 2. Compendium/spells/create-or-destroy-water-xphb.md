- **Casting time:** 1 Action

You do one of the following:

- **Create Water.** You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot [Cube](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range, extinguishing exposed flames there.  
- **Destroy Water.** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot [Cube](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range.  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the [Cube](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) increases by 5 feet, for each spell slot level above 1.
