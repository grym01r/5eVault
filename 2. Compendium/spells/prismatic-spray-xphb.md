# Prismatic Spray
*7th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot [Cone](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in the [Cone](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll `1d8` to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.

**Prismatic Rays**

| dice: 1d8 | Ray |
|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:* `12d6` Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* `12d6` Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* `12d6` Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:* `12d6` Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* `12d6` Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Restrained](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Restrained) condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [Petrified](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Petrified) condition until it is freed by an effect like the [Greater Restoration](greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). |
| 8 | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8. |
