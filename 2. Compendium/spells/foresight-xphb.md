# Foresight
*9th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the target has [Advantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on [D20 Tests](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), and other creatures have [Disadvantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against it. The spell ends early if you cast it again.
