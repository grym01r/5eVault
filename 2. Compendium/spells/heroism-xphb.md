# Heroism
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition and gains [Temporary Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
