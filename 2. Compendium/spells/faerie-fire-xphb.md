- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects in a 20-foot [Cube](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the [Cube](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.
