- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes `1d8` Cold damage, and its [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
