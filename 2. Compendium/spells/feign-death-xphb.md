# Feign Death
*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Incapacitated](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Incapacitated) conditions, and its [Speed](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0.

The target also has [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [Immunity](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.
