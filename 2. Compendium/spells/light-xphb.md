# Light
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [Bright Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
