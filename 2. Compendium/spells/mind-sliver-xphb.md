# Mind Sliver
*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You try to temporarily sliver the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take `1d6` Psychic damage and subtract `1d4` from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).
