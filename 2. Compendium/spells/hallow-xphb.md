# Hallow
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 24 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy or unholy power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of Hallow. The affected area has the following effects.

## Hallowed Ward

Choose any of these creature types: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Creatures of the chosen types can't willingly enter the area, and any creature that is possessed by or that has the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition from such creatures isn't possessed, [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed), or [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) by them while in the area.

## Extra Effect

You bind an extra effect to the area from the list below:

- **Courage.** Creatures of any types you choose can't gain the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition while in the area.  
- **Darkness.** [Darkness](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a level lower than this spell, can't illuminate the area.  
- **Daylight.** Bright light fills the area. Magical [Darkness](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) created by spells of a level lower than this spell can't extinguish the light.  
- **Peaceful Rest.** [Dead](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/dead-xphb.md) bodies interred in the area can't be turned into Undead.  
- **Extradimensional Interference.** Creatures of any types you choose can't enter or exit the area using teleportation or interplanar travel.  
- **Fear.** Creatures of any types you choose have the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) condition while in the area.  
- **Resistance.** Creatures of any types you choose have [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to one damage type of your choice while in the area.  
- **Silence.** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.  
- **Tongues.** Creatures of any types you choose can communicate with any other creature in the area even if they don't share a common language.  
- **Vulnerability.** Creatures of any types you choose have [Vulnerability](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/vulnerability-xphb.md) to one damage type of your choice while in the area.
