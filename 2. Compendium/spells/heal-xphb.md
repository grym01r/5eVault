# Heal
*6th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. Positive energy washes through the target, restoring 70 [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). This spell also ends the [Blinded](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Blinded), [Deafened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Deafened), and [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) conditions on the target.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `10` for each spell slot level above 6.
