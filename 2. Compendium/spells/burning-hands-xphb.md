# Burning Hands
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot [Cone](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the [Cone](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](burning-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
