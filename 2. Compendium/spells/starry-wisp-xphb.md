# Starry Wisp
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d8` Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits [Dim Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [Invisible](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
