# Chill Touch
*cantrip, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Channeling the chill of the grave, make a melee spell attack against a target within reach. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` Necrotic damage, and it can't regain [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) until the end of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d10` when you reach levels 5 (`2d10`), 11 (`3d10`), and 17 (`4d10`).
