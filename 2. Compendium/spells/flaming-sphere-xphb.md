# Flaming Sphere
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ball of wax)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `2d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a [Bonus Action](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](burning-xphb.md) if touched by the sphere, and it sheds [Bright Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
