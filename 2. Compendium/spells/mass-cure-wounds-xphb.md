# Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point. Each target regains [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `5d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
