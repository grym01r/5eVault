# Finger of Death
*7th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `7d8 + 30` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [Zombie](zombie-xmm.md) that follows your verbal orders.
