# Calm Emotions
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):

- The creature has [Immunity](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions until the spell ends. If the creature was already [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) or [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened), those conditions are suppressed for the duration.  
- The creature becomes [Indifferent](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) about creatures of your choice that it's [Hostile](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal.
