# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the creature has the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed), [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened), [Paralyzed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned), or [Stunned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Stunned) condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [Prone](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Prone) condition, it can use its [Reaction](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to stand up.
