# Extreme Cold
*Environmental Hazard*  


When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level. Creatures that have [Resistance](0.%20DM%20Screen/Variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) or [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.
