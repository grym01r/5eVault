# Planar Effects
*Environmental Hazard*  


Certain planes of existence—and areas on the Material Plane affected by them—have supernatural effects on creatures within them. Several examples are presented below. See "chapter 6" for more information about the planes of existence.

## Acheronian Bloodlust

The plane of "Acheron" rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing it with the strength to keep fighting. While in Acheron or a region under its influence, a creature gains [Temporary Hit Points](temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) equal to half its Hit Point maximum whenever it reduces another creature to 0 Hit Points.

## Arcadian Vitality

On the plane of "Arcadia" and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures benefit from supernatural vitality, which grants them [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) the [Frightened](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Frightened) and [Poisoned](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Poisoned) conditions.

## Blessed Beneficence

On the plane of "Mount Celestia" and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures are blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures other than Fiends and Undead gain the benefit of the [Bless](bless-xphb.md) spell as long as they remain in an area of blessed beneficence. In addition, such a creature that finishes a Long Rest in the area gains the benefit of a [Lesser Restoration](lesser-restoration-xphb.md) spell.

## Gehennan Cruelty

On the plane of "Gehenna" and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures are driven to loathe helping one another. Whenever a creature subject to Gehennan cruelty casts a spell, including a spell that restores Hit Points or removes a condition other than [Invisible](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Invisible), the caster must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, or the spell fails and is wasted.

## Winds of Pandemonium

The winds of "Pandemonium" are common in Pandemonium and regions where its influence is felt, including parts of the Underdark. A creature makes a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level. The winds can't increase a creature's [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level above 3. Finishing a Long Rest doesn't reduce a creature's Exhaustion level unless the creature can somehow escape the winds.
