# Poisonous Gas
*Generic Hazard*  


Poisonous gas is usually encountered in an enclosed space, such as a sewer or sealed tomb. The gas fills as much space as it can, up to a maximum of ten 10-foot [Cubes](cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). The transparent gas carries a foul odor. The gas is continuously or periodically replenished by some natural or magical source, though a strong wind disperses the gas for 1 minute.

Any creature that enters poisonous gas for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (`1d10`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the gas also have [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on [Death Saving Throws](death-saving-throw-xphb.md).

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Poison damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Poison Damage | Save DC |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 5–10 | 11 (`2d10`) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`4d10`) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`10d10`) | 18 |
