# Heavy Precipitation
*Environmental Hazard*  


Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is [Lightly Obscured](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md), and creatures in the area have [Disadvantage](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on all Wisdom ([Perception](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Perception)) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
