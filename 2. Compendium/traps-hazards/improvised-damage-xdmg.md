# Improvised Damage
*Generic Hazard*  


The Improvising Damage table gives guidelines for determining damage on the fly.

![Improvising Damage](0.%20DM%20Screen/tables/improvising-damage-xdmg.md)

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage amounts are for characters of different levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage.

![Improvising Damage; Damage Severity and Level](0.%20DM%20Screen/tables/improvising-damage-damage-severity-and-level-xdmg.md)

Nuisance damage rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the levels shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

Deadly damage poses a significant threat to characters of the levels shown and could potentially kill such a character that's missing many [Hit Points](0.%20DM%20Screen/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).
