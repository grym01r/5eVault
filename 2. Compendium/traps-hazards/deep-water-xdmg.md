# Deep Water
*Environmental Hazard*  


Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water's pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [Exhaustion](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level.
