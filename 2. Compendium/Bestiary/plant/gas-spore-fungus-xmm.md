Gas spores are floating, orbicular fungi with rhizome growths and protuberances that resemble the stalks and eyes of beholders. If destroyed, a gas spore explodes in a poisonous burst that can infect creatures and slay them in hours. Infected corpses spawn more gas spores that grow to full size in a matter of days.

## Fungi

*Deadly Spores and Predatory Polyps*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

The dank, sunless Underdark is a fertile breeding ground for weird and dangerous fungi.
