## Wight

*Life-Leeching Corpse Warrior*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Planar (Shadowfell), Swamp, Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** [Armaments](random-magic-items-armaments.md)  

Wights are the withered corpses of relentless warriors whose wickedness sustains them beyond death. Unlike mere zombies, they retain the memories and evil agendas they harbored in life.

After dying and returning from the grave, a wight continues its villainous ways, but it is now driven by a hunger for life. A wight drains living essence through its attacks. Humanoids slain by a wight's life-sapping grip reanimate a day later and serve the wight as obedient zombies.

Wights might return from the dead for a multitude of sinister reasons. Roll on or choose a result from the Wight Motives table to inspire why a wight plagues the living.
