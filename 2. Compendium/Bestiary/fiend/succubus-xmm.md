## Succubus

*Life-Draining Seducer*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Lower Planes), Urban  
- **Treasure.** [Implements](random-magic-items-implements.md)  

Succubi prey on mortals physically and exploit their waking desires. They relish corrupting virtuous souls and the pain an individual's downfall can cause. Once their targets are at their lowest, succubi slay their victims with their essence-draining kiss.

Through fiendish rites, succubi can transform into incubi to manipulate their prey in dreams as well as the waking world. They can also change shape to torment their victims. These tempters can dominate Humanoids, but they usually do so to reinforce their manipulations or defend themselves rather than controlling others outright. Roll on or choose a result from the Succubus Temptations table to inspire how a succubus toys with its victims.
