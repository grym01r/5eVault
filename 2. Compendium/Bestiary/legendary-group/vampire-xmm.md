## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a vampire's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Children of the Night.** The vampire exerts influence over the animals in its domain. From dusk until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the [Charmed](0.%20DM%20Screen/conditions.md#Charmed) condition while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Looming Shadows.** Shadows within 1 mile of the lair seem to move as if alive. Any creature (excluding the vampire and its allies) that finishes a [Short Rest](short-rest-xphb.md) while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  
- **Mists.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [Lightly Obscured](lightly-obscured-xphb.md) by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire and any creatures of its choice are unaffected by the fog.  

If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
