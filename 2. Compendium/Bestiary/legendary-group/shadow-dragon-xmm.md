# Shadow Dragon

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) from a spell, it subtracts `1d10` from the number of [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) regained.  
- **Stifling Shadows.** Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) instead create [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md), and creatures there have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](0.%20DM%20Screen/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
