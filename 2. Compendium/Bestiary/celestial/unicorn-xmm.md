## Unicorn

*Majestic and Magical Forest Master*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Unicorns are majestic defenders of forests. They are revered by many Fey and other forest dwellers, and they do whatever they can to ensure the peace and health of those who shelter in their wooded realms.

### Unicorn Lairs

Unicorns dwell in unspoiled forests, particularly where benevolent Fey creatures live.
