## Druid

*Steward and Sage of Nature*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Individual, [Relics](random-magic-items-relics.md)  

Druids use primal magic, traditional teachings, and bonds with animals and eldritch beings to guard the natural world and heal its ills. These magic-users might be recluses devoted to a particular land, or they might be part of a mystic organization. Roll on or choose a result from the Druidic Traditions table to inspire a druid's magical practices.
