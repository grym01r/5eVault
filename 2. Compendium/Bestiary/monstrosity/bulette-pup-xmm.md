Juvenile bulettes are known as pups. They travel in small groups, using their numbers to bring down larger foes. Their arrival frequently presages the appearance of an adult bulette.

## Bulettes

*Ravenous, Subsurface Land Sharks*

- **Habitat.** Grassland, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** None  

Also called "land sharks," bulettes are single-minded predators that burrow under, leap over, and burst through obstacles in pursuit of their quarry. They burrow rapidly just below ground. On sensing movement, they erupt from below, attempting to catch prey in their oversize maws.
