Cockatrices often try to claim eye-catching structures—such as ruins and secluded farms—as roosts.

## Cockatrices

*Accursed Avians with the Power to Petrify*

- **Habitat.** Grassland  
- **Treasure.** None  

Cockatrices combine the features of irate roosters and starving reptiles. They petrify those they bite, their slightest peck turning their prey to stone.
