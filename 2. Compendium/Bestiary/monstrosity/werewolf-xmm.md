## Werewolf

*Changed by the Ferocity of the Wolf*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Hill  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Werewolves change from their humanoid forms into fierce wolves or wolf-humanoid hybrids. Werewolves can shape-shift voluntarily, but many can't resist transforming during the nights of a full moon.
